# Promise

A Promise is like a guarantee that something will be done later — either successfully or with a failure.

# Callback

A callback is simply a function passed as an argument to another function — to be called later, usually after some task is done.

Hey, do this now... and when you're done, run this other function.

- You drop your clothes and leave your phone number.
- The tailor says: “I’ll call you when it's ready.”
- Your number = callback function.
- When ready = they call you back.
